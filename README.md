# terraform-plan-reviewer
Parses Terraform plan JSON output and provides filtered alternative output.

A change in Terraform behavior from v0.11.x to v0.12.x results in increased verbosity when outputting the specs of a resource that will change.  This behavior can make it more difficult to manually review changes before plan execution.

This module attempts to consolidate the plan output and reduce noise.  It will also attempt to predict instances in which changes will not actually occur even though TF plan has flagged it for change.

The input file for this module should be generated by running terraform show -json and piping output to file.

For example:
terraform show -json <tf_generated_plan_file> > plan.json

To process the json file run:
node <full_path_to_index.js> <plan_json_file>

Module will read json file from the current working directory.  It will assume the file name is plan.json, if no filename is specified at the commandline.
